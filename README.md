This API returns a default number of 10 results per page, and a maximum possible value of 50.

To modify page number, or results per page, include a "pageSize" and "pageNumber" parameter in the query.

## Known Bugs

_There are currently no known bugs, however with the current pagination implementation, the total number of database entries is not provided, so listing the total number of results, or pages of results, is not possible._
